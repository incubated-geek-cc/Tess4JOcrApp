Resume Building
According to the wiki definition,
A resume is a brief summary of your skills and experience over one or two pages.
A resume must be built according to a specificjob opening and the company.
Resumes can have different formats based on the profile for which you are applying,
the company to which you are applying etc. Here, we will discuss a format which is
suitable for the role of Software Developers. Below are some of the key points that
everyone should keep in mind while writing a Resume:
Single Page Resume: The most common mistake that everyone makes is to
write every possible detail about themselves in their resume which makes their
resumes lengthy up to 2-3 pages. Recruiters do not have this much of time to
read a complete resume of 2-3 pages, they hardly pay around 20-30 seconds
on each resume. So, keep your resume short up to a single page. Also, when
you are writing less then you will write only important things about you.
No Career Objective: This is also a common mistake done by job aspirants. A
career objective generally read as, “Objective: To utilize my knowledge, skills,
and abilities as a Software Engineer”. Focusing on this quoted sentence it
basically states the position you are applying for and your interests which the
recruiter already knows. 80, including this will only end up eating space in your
resume.
Include Accomplishments: Try to make your resume accomplishment-
oriented and not responsibilities oriented. Accomplishments state the things you
have achieved and how well do you have managed your responsibilities.
Count Matters: Do not get confuse with the word count here. By count, we
mean that you should always specify the count whenever you are including any
accomplishment in your resume. For Example, if you have won any competition
then do specify this achievement along with your rank.
Avoid Grammatical Mistakes: Do read your resume multiple times to check if
there is any grammatical error.
